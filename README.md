This repository contains some of the screenshots from the two challenges that were part of the Snyk CTF. 

The challenges included one prototype pollution challenge which was worth 50 points. This challenge revolved around Node and __proto__. 

The second challenge was a serialization / deserialization challenge which was worth 150 points. The deserialiszation challenge revolved around python3 and the pickle module.
